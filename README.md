## gif-search-app-using-firebase-auth

Tech stack used : React.js, Firebase-Auth
<br>
Deployment Platofrm : Vercel
<br>
Main deployment link : https://firebase-auth-giphy.vercel.app/


Here, I have deployed my whole project task in with two different repositories. 

1) Repo 1: https://github.com/meet2632/firebase-auth-giphy - Firebase auth of users
2) Repo 2: https://github.com/meet2632/gif-searching-app - Giphy-search app

I have added the navigation of deployed link of giphy app in firebase auth repo code pre-deployment.
The reason I was not able to integrate both parts in one project was a lot of errors arising and given the time of task completion, it was difficult for me to solve so I have created another project for authentication later on integrated separately with deployment to main task project of developing gif search app.
